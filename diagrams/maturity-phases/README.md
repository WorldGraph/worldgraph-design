# Worldgraph maturity phases

This describes a vision for increasing maturity of a worldwide, distributed knowledge system

## Phase 1

Local storage, retrieval, and indexing 

## Phase 2

Local import of remote data sources, 
- SPARQL data from WikiData.  
- User annotation of imported data sources.
- Schema import conversion for JSON-LD schemas

## Phase 3

Distributed storage and retrieval + local indexing

Requirements
- Distributed, mutable storage (current solution: Ceramic on IPFS)
- Local indexing.  Solution needed.  Possibility: elasticsearch.

## Phase 4

Distributed storage, retrieval, and indexing

Requirements
- Distributed indexing.  Possibility: The Graph
